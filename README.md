# Predictive-models-on-NYC-Taxi-Trip-dataset

This dataset contains information about the taxi trips 
that took place in different parts of New York City and how much time did that trip take to complete.
In this project, the following are the tasks are completed. Choosing the most suitable evaluation metric and state why you chose it, Building a benchmark model for the given dataset. Building a K-Nearest neighboursâ€™ model for the given dataset and find the best value of K. Build a Linear model for the given dataset with regularisation. Attempt to interpret the variable coefficients of the Linear Model. Build a Decision tree model for the given dataset. Attempt to interpret the variable importance. Plot the following Bar plots, train score of all the above models. test (not validation!) score of all the above models. Attempt to explain the observations from the plots
